This is a contract that acts/mimics a piggy bank in a way.

# This contract allows  for deposits/withdrawals. 
# After a condition is met the contract selfdestructs, 

This is a project where I practice sending ETH and receiving ETH and by practicing security mesures so there is no re-entrancy attacks.
I've used the receive() function to handle incoming ether and used selfdestruct once the contract is withdraw of all of its funds.

Love to hear some feedback! :)
